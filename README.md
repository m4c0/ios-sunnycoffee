An old attempt of making an iOS game using SpriteKit.

Code is provided AS-IS under the MIT license. Use it at your own risk.

Honestly, I can't remember the story or gameplay. I found it in my backups and
I'm publishing it for no particular reason.

Graphics are boilerplate using images from a pack named Cute God, by Daniel
Cook. Original website was http://lostgarden.com but that domain is dead now.
It seems there is a backup at https://lostgarden.home.blog but I'm not sure
that is official or if it will last.
